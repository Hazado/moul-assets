An American film, stage, television and voice actor, David Ogden Stiers was probably best known for his role as Major Charles Emerson Winchester III on the television show, M*A*S*H. But to Uru fans, he was the voice of Jeff Zandi, our desert guide sitting beside his Airstream who assisted us in finding our way into the cavern. He also lent his voice & likeness to Esher in Myst V: End of Ages (2005) where his pronunciation of "D'ni" led fans to say it sounded like he was saying "duck knee". Stiers also provided the voice of Dr. Richard Watson in a recording found in the Kirel community room in the offline versions of Uru. Fondly remembered by Cyan employees who met him, his name was added to the memorial on 6 March 2018.<pb>Phil "Enders" Rose

Grandbad had a great sense of humor and was very good at manipulating Age objects using the extra commands in the Open Cave client; he used to take explorers on journey tours through the Ages stopping at various places. He used to play more on The Open Cave and Deep Island than MOULa, but often helped out with door runs and testing marker games. He had been suffering with a long term illness for which there is no cure; he passed surrounded by family and friends.

"I first met Bill in The Open Cave (TOC) Shard. He was in the 'City Of Dimensions'  (COD) age playing with Jodok and invited me to join them. We immediately got along and became firm friends. Sadly we never physically met. he was a wizard at manipulating the various objects in 'Relto' and 'The City Of Dimensions' to make items and move them around. He used to get all the cones to march from the Disco in COD to the edge of the age and back again. He also used to move the tent at Takotah I and the ferry in COD all over the place in COD. He used to get them to travel around the top of the Great Zero  or through the Plaza. He wrote a script that attached the two smoke pillars at the Guild hall to the smoke stack of the house boat on the lake. he then moved the houseboat through the Arch and back again. He also would also get us all seated then take us on journey tours through the age stopping at various places.  He used to enjoy moving the Bahro pillars, pine trees and other stuff around in Relto using the extra KI commands available in TOC. he caught me out once when I linked into his Bevin. he had built one of the obects allowed by the Ki at the linkin spot. When I linked in it exploded  and sent cones and Eddie the beachball in all directions. It was very funny. He had a great sense of humour. He was always willing to test the marker games In TOC for me.

We also used to play a lot in Deep Island. He introduced me to SandDoone who has also become a very dear friend. We all played a lot together investigating the ages. I am going to miss that very much. We did not play much in MOULa. The two of us played a bit in Minkata Prime and Minkata-Alpha s well as Adam's Trollland. We played a bit in MOULa and helped out with door runs. Jodok will be able to tell you more about his time on MOULa." - Philip

In 1967, he appeared on London's West End in the musical "Sweet Charity" in the role of Vittorio Vidal; this was the first West End production of Neil Simon's Broadway hit. In 1974, he appeared on Broadway in The Royal Shakespeare Theatre's revival of "Sherlock Holmes" from 1974 to 1976, in the role of Sir Edward Leighton, at the Broadhurst Theatre.

He wrote, produced, and performed a one-man show, "Expressions of Aging". This two-act play with music reflects his love of history, acting, music, and the English language, on the theme of growing old. He performed selections until late in his life.

Eventually Keston moved to Bemidji, Minnesota, where he had been recruited by Dr. Fulton Gallagher to teach voice in the music department of Bemidji State University.

He began running at age 55 to combat mild hypertension. On 30 September 2001, at age 76, he set a world age record when he ran a 3:22:59 marathon in the Portland Marathon. At ages 80 and 85, he set world age records for 12-kilometers in the Bloomsday Run in Spokane, Washington.

OOC NOTE: This is not for the in-game character, but for the real-life person who was the inspiration for Uru's Jeff Zandi.

A friend of the Miller brothers and the inspiration for the Uru character of the same name, Jeff Zandi was well-known in the Texas Magic: The Gathering community for forming the Texas Guildmages, which has run for over two decades. He was a part of every meeting up until his death.

He also helped found the Hunter Burton Memorial Open, a regular Magic: The Gathering charity event to promote awareness about suicide prevention within the gaming community, named after a young man from the MTG community who tragically took his own life in July 2013.

Jeff is survived by his wife Willa and son Lawson.

5 September 1954 - 24 May 2014

Planet Pluto (Federal Way, WA.)

Zardoz's roots in the Myst/Uru Community can be traced back to at least Spring 2001 when he pursued the mystery of the realMyst Easter Eggs, documenting it thoroughly on his website, Zardoz's realMyst Easter Egg Hunt and other Goodies, and a year later, documenting Zandi's mysterious clues with the pages Zandi Facts. He participated in the Uru Live Beta (Choru), Prologue (opening the Bahro door in Eder Kemo to let Phil Henderson out), D'mala, Myst Online: Uru Live (GameTap era) and MOULagain. Although he was "not much of a social explorer" in the cavern, Zardoz was very active in the community through CyanChat and forums, gave a "realMyst flymode" presentation at Mysterium 2003, assisted with the DRC Liaisons election near the end of D'mala, answered Myst/Uru related questions on the forums, and offered advice on many other topics. His sense of humor is revealed in the February 2007 D'ni Network Pen and Ink Interview with Zardoz, his creativity can be seen in the OpenUru Writers Club: The Fall of a Sparrow: A Zardoz Project, and both are evident in the brief storyline he conducted in the summer of 2007. Zardoz backed Cyan's Obduction Kickstarter in October 2013 and was generally active in the community until a few months before his death.

After taking some time investigating the new library, we came across a Linking Book to the Age of Veelay Tsahvahn, or "immortal soul" in D'ni.
While we still have to find documentation about this Age, upon first Linking in, we were amazed by how well it had held up compared to most other D'ni Ages we've visited. There was barely any structural damage or heavy wear and tear due to the elements.
We've sent some samples back to our team for carbon dating, so we'll see just how old this Age is.

Incredible!  Preliminary testing shows that this Age could predate the exodus to the D'ni cavern, meaning it may very well have come from Garternay! If further testing holds true, Veelay Tsahvahn could very well have been Written nearly 12,000 years ago.
As it stands, the structures here are not made of the signature nara usually found in D'ni architecture, which also may hint at a very early life for this Age. Nevertheless, they've held up very well.
The skies have remained clear and pristine, showing off many celestial bodies in the sky as well as some beautiful aurora. There's also evidence that this particular side of the planet stays in perpetual twilight, further keeping the structures from degrading. This Age was indeed Written to last, but for what reason?

Some progress on figuring out this Age.

Korov'ev has translated the plaque just in front of the tree when first Linking in. It appears to be a prayer first discovered by Richard Watson years ago.

It reads:

"In the rock, they lived.
In the rock, they rest.
Yahvo receive their souls."

Additionally, volunteers have been perusing, organizing, and cataloging the stacks of books in the library on Teshafee and have found a book of commentary for this Age. Korov'ev was able to translate a good portion of that as well.
Given the above quote from the plaque and the commentary, it seems Veelay was used as an Age to memorialize and remember those of the Ronay, and later the D'ni, who had passed away. It served as a location for funerals and wakes of sorts.
This would explain why the Writer of this Age did their best to make it as geologically and meteorologically stable as possible. It also explains the very minimal amount of wear and tear the Age has gone through despite being here for millennia.

So many projects, so little time! I do like to come back here quite often for the peace and quiet. You can feel the history and reverence that surrounded this relatively simple Age.
An Age to remember those who are gone. It makes me think of my grandfather Raymond, who passed away just several months ago.  I like to think he would have loved to see this.
I also think about quite a few of the explorers I've known over the years who have passed on. So many good people taken far too soon.

Perhaps Veelay could be used to honor them as well, as the Ronay and D'ni once did...

After speaking with Tai'lahr, we've both agreed that using this Age as a memorial to those explorers who are no longer with us would be a fitting extension of the memorial in the Kahlo Pub.
Tai has been kind enough to gather information about each of the names on that memorial, and I've decided to incorporate all of it into hand-written journals that can be located on the pedestals at the top of the main structure.
Those just coming to the cavern can read about those who have helped us restore it . . . who left their mark on our little community of explorers and touched our lives forever.

I'm hoping this will be a fitting tribute to all of them.

I return to Veelay Tsahvahn with mixed emotions. My grandmother passed away just a few days ago, so the meaning of this Age continues to grow for me as we make it ready for the general public.

In the midst of the holidays, a thought occurs to me after yet another loss. It's amazing how pets can become like a member of the family, and their loss is felt almost as deeply as their human counterparts.
In this spirit, I plan to make a small addition to this Age to honor our furry companions as well...and for me, one in particular.

Jack the cat . . . we miss you, buddy.

It's been a while since I last Linked here, but each visit here brings both somber feelings and a renewed determination for Age restoration and rebuilding. The journals detailing our late friends have been completed and amended . . . including Tai'lahr, who passed just a couple of months ago. She was the driving force behind this whole thing, and for that and more, she is truly missed.

All that's left now are the usual safety checks . . . a mere formality. I truly hope those who come here, especially those who have lost a loved one in and out of the cavern, can find peace and serenity when visiting this Age, and think upon those who are no longer with us. They will not be forgotten.

So long as we remember them, their ending shall never be written.<PB>Special Thanks

Rhee for the original design concept
Tai'lahr for putting together the explorers' memorial, putting stories to the names from the Kahlo Pub, and for being an all around wonderful person. We miss you, Tai.
